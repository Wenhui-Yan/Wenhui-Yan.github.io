          <p>
            Today, I built my first personal website.
          </p>
          <p>
            It may appear simple, but to me, it represents something larger - a conscious
            step toward shaping my academic journey. As I begin my graduate studies in
            vegetation remote sensing, working on solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence
            (SIF) and drought stress, I increasingly feel the importance of documenting not
            only results, but also thoughts, questions, and growth.
          </p>
          <p>
            Research is not a sequence of publications. It is a process of becoming.
          </p>

          <h3>Why I Decided to Build This Space</h3>
          <p>
            Over the past few years, I have often visited the personal websites of
            researchers whose work I admire. What impressed me was not only their
            publications, but the clarity of their intellectual paths - how their interests
            evolved, how questions deepened, and how curiosity sustained their work over
            time.
          </p>
          <p>
            I realized that building a personal website is not just about visibility. It is
            about intention.
          </p>
          <p>By creating this space, I hope to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Think more rigorously</li>
            <li>Write more clearly</li>
            <li>Record how my understanding of vegetation-climate interactions evolves</li>
            <li>Reflect on the broader meaning of studying ecosystem stress</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Perhaps years later, as a Ph.D. student or researcher, I will return to this
            page and see how my scientific identity first began to take shape.
          </p>

          <h3>Learning Beyond Research</h3>
          <p>
            Technically, this website was built using GitHub Pages, along with some basic
            HTML and CSS customization. The process was simple but meaningful. Adjusting
            templates, troubleshooting small formatting issues, and finally seeing the site
            go live reminded me that building something - whether a webpage or a research
            framework - requires patience and iteration.
          </p>
          <p>
            When the page finally went online, I refreshed it several times just to confirm
            it existed.
          </p>
          <p>
            That quiet excitement felt important. It marked a transition from consuming
            knowledge to actively presenting and organizing it.
          </p>

          <h3>What I Hope This Website Will Hold</h3>
          <p>In the coming years, I hope this space will document:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>My research on SIF and vegetation physiological responses to drought</li>
            <li>Field experiments and methodological reflections</li>
            <li>Notes on papers that shape my thinking</li>
            <li>Questions that remain unresolved</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            More than a portfolio, I hope this website becomes a record of intellectual
            development - including uncertainty, revisions, and gradual clarity.
          </p>
          <p>Science advances through refinement. So do researchers.</p>

          <h3>Beyond the Lab</h3>
          <p>
            Outside of research, I enjoy playing table tennis and taking long walks. Table
            tennis teaches me rhythm and precision. Walking gives me time to think slowly -
            sometimes the best ideas emerge not in front of a screen, but under an open
            sky.
          </p>
          <p>
            I believe that doing science well requires both intensity and calmness - the
            ability to focus deeply, and the patience to wait for understanding to mature.
          </p>
          <p>
            Writing in English is still a learning process for me, but I hope it allows me
            to connect with a wider academic community and participate in conversations
            beyond borders.
          </p>

          <h3>Looking Forward</h3>
          <p>This is only the first post.</p>
          <p>
            I do not yet know where this journey will lead - whether toward deeper questions
            about ecosystem resilience, climate impacts, or new remote sensing
            methodologies. But I know that curiosity, persistence, and thoughtful reflection
            will guide the way.
          </p>
          <p>For now, this small beginning feels meaningful.</p>
          <p>And every long journey begins with one step.</p>
